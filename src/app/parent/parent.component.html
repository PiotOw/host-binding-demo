  parent works!

<app-child class="blue" [blue]="false"></app-child>

<h4>
  Expected: child-component text-color to be default (red) when Input [blue] is set to false

  Case: parent-component assigns .blue class to child-component

  Setbacks: <br>
  1. problems with refactors (like changing the class name) <br>
  2. child component has misleading information about its state <br>

 Setbacks fixed: <br>
 1. problems with refactors (like changing the class name) - relevant classnames only appear inside the component <br>
 2. child component has misleading information about its state - component is completely self-contained - only component can change its state
  <br>
 3. if child component's Input is a setter, it works horribly - all information provided by Input is complete and can't be overridden by parent
