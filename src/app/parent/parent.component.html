<div>
  parent works!
</div>
<h5>
  The problem is when we want to add for example the variants of the component where the text is solid color (with 2
  options of color)
</h5>
<h5>
  Basically when there are multiple non-boolean inputs changing style of child
</h5>
<div class="wrapper--available-space">
  <app-child [variant]="'warn'" [backgroundGradientVariant]="'happy'">child works!</app-child>
</div>
<p>We have to unbind Inputs from HostBinding and instead create getter HostBinding which returns multiple classes at once</p>
<p>Also: the style changing classes are not assigned to the element they are changing, instead the multi-depth nesting is required</p>

<div class="wrapper--available-space">
  <app-child-no-binding [variant]="'success'" [backgroundGradientVariant]="'sad'">child no binding works!</app-child-no-binding>
</div>
