<div>
  parent works!
</div>

<p>
  Sometimes we want to change things that require styling :host element:
</p>
<p>
  Case:
  If we had styling component: radial-gradient as a background with text in it
</p>
<h3>
  -- Display
</h3>
<h5>
  normally we want it to take whole available space
</h5>
<div class="wrapper--available-space">
  <app-child>child works!</app-child>
</div>

<h5>
  But sometimes we want it to act like normal text in a block of text:
</h5>
<span>
  this is a <app-child [type]="'inline'">child component!</app-child> which is awesome
</span>
<hr>
<p>
  It can work with HostBinding('class') but we can achieve the same result by setting the app-child style inside parent component
</p>

<div class="wrapper--available-space">
  <app-child-no-binding>child works!</app-child-no-binding>
</div>

<span>
  this is a <app-child-no-binding class="gradient-text--inline">child component!</app-child-no-binding> which is awesome
</span>

<h5>The positioning of a child should be parent's responsibility</h5>
