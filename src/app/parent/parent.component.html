<div>
parent works!
</div>

<app-child class="blue" [blue]="false"></app-child>

<!-- Expected: child-component text-color to be default (red) when Input [blue] is set to false -->

<!-- Case: parent-component assigns .blue class to child-component -->

<!-- Issue: parent can set the child "type" to .blue without the use of Angular Input -->

<!-- Setbacks: -->
<!-- 1. problems with refactors (like changing the class name) -->
<!-- 2. child component has misleading information about its state -->
<!-- 3. if child component's Input is a setter, it works horribly -->
